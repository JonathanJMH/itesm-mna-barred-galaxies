# Barred Galaxies Dataset Tool

A Python tool for detecting barred galaxies in astronomical images. Part of my Master's degree project at ITESM, in
collaboration with UNAM's Insituto de Astronom√≠a.

## Installing dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

All scripts and tools are contained in the `bargal` (short for **bar**red **gal**axies) package. This package contains
CLI applications to manage the dataset, as well as modules that are used as part of the implementation of the Jupyter
notebooks.

To install the `bargal` package, from the repository root run:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Download images

The basic dataset is included in this repository; however, due to size constraints, the actual images are not included.
You can download the images using the `bargal-datasetdown` command.

To download galaxy images from a CSV dataset, run the following command:

```bash
bargal-datasetdown data/dataset.csv --o output/directory
```

It is recommended to use `data/images` as the output directory.

By adding the `--by-bands` flag, this command will also download individual images for each band.

```bash
bargal-datasetdown data/dataset.csv -o data/images --by-bands
```

It is also possible to use the `--skip` and `--top` options to limit the number of images downloaded. This is useful for
downloading a subset of the images for this dataset or for applying pagination logic to download images in batches.

For example, the following command will only download the first 10 records:

```bash
bargal-datasetdown data/dataset.csv -o data/images --by-bands --top 10
```

And then the following command will skip the first 10 records and download the next 10:

```bash
bargal-datasetdown data/dataset.csv -o data/images --by-bands --skip 10 --top 10
```

### Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory are designed to help you analyze the downloaded images. If the
`bargal` package is installed, you can import any of the modules directly in the notebooks.
